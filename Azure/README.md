# Azure Tools
Tools to assist in integrating Secure Workload in your Azure environment

Azure scripts come in two flavors, a powershell and a terraform variant. 

Both assume Azure CLI is installed.
[Install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/azure/install-azure-cli)

For the terraform variant:
`terraform init`
</br>`terraform plan`
</br>`terraform apply`

For the powershell variant:

Ensure this module is installed. With a powershell opened as administrator:

`Install-Module Az`
</br>`Import-Module Az`
